# ULP Reference Solution

Universal Learner Passbook (ULP) solution is a credential management system that enables secure generation, access, and sharing of verifiable digital credentials. These credentials can represent both traditional physical documents, such as report cards and achievement certificates, as well as new concepts without physical equivalents, like attestations of specific learning competencies.
	
ULP streamlines education ecosystem processes by providing easy access to consent-based verifiable credentials for various services such as admissions, scholarships, and certifications. It creates a high-trust, low-cost infrastructure, allowing users to manage their credentials and ensuring data reliability through digital signatures and attestations. ULP enables seamless onboarding and data sharing across systems, while complying with data protection and privacy laws.
